# ScotsPine_RNAseq_DNB
The repository contains the nf-core pipeline, differential expression analysis and annotation scripts for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) transcriptomic response to Dothistroma Needle Blight (DNB). 
The input files for nf-core pipeline, which contains:
i. Samplesheet_full.csv (RNA-seq sample information used in this study, RNA was extracted from each sample in this study and did paired-end sequencing using the Illumina WGS platform.)
ii. slurm2.config (The workflow configuration script specified a resource configuration file)
iii. ptabuliformis.fa (Comlpete genomic DNA sequence of P. tabuliformis in FASTA format)
iv. P.tabuliformis_V1.0.gene.final.renamed.gtf (The annotation file of P. tabuliformis - exon locations, gene IDs, transcript structures)
These files are restored on HPC.
